--- # Metadata

# The entity that made the attestation. It is not a real field. Verifiers are

attester: GitHubActions

--- # Payload

# --- Fields present in all attestations ---

# URI identifying what this attestation means and the schema for the rest of the
# payload. Only a small set of well-defined types are expected.
#
# Provenance explains the process that produced the subject.
type: https://in-toto.io/Provenance/v1

# The collection of artifacts that this attestation is about.
#
# - Key: URI or path-noscheme (RFC 3986) identifying the artifact. If there is a
#   single artifact and the name is not meaningful, use "_" as the key.
#   Verifiers MUST consider the key as security relevant. For URIs, Package URL
#   (once finalized) or SPDX Download Location (e.g. git+https) is RECOMMENDED.
#
# - Value: Set of cryptographic content digests.
#
# For provenance, this is the products of the build process.

# --- Fields specific to provenance type ---

# Idenfifies the entity that executed the build steps. In many cases, the
# builder is different from the attester.
builder:
  # URI indicating the builder's identity as well as the schema of this object.
  #
  # The following value means that the build was executed by GitHub Actions.
  id: git+https://github.com/actions/attestations@v1#builder

  # The rest of the fields are specific to `id`.

  # String identifying what system ran the actual build actions.
  # - For GitHub hosted runners, the value is "github-hosted".
  # - For self-hosted runners, the value is TBD to indicate which specific
  #   runner was used.
  runner: github-hosted

# Describes the actions that the builder performed.
recipe:
  # URI indicating what type of recipe was performed. It determines the meaning
  # of `entry_point`, `arguments`, and the top-level `materials` and
  # `reproducibility`.
  #
  # The following value means that the recipe is a GitHub Actions Workflow.
  type: git+https://github.com/actions/attestations@v1#recipe

  # The artifact in `materials` containing the recipe steps that are not implied
  # by `type`. For example, if the recipe type were "make", then this would
  # point to the Makefile, not the `make` program itself.
  #
  # Omit this field (or use null) if the recipe doesn't come from a material.
  #
  # TODO: What if there is more than one material?
  #
  # For GitHub Actions Workflow, it is the git repository containing the
  # `.github/workflows/$WORKFLOW` file.
  material: git+https://github.com/curl/curl@curl-7_72_0

  # String identifying the entry point. The meaning is defined by `type`.
  #
  # For GitHub Actions Workflow, it is "$WORKFLOW:$JOB".
  entry_point: build.yaml:maketgz

  # Set of input arguments that influenced the build on top of `material` and
  # `entry_point`.
  # It is an object whose schema is defined by `type`, or may be null or
  # undefined to indicate "no arguments."
  #
  # For GitHub Actions Workflow, it is the workflow_dispatch inputs.
  # (TODO: any others?)
  arguments: null

# The set of input artifacts that influenced the build. The type is the same as
# `subject`, but use of path-noscheme keys is DISCOURAGED.
#
# TODO: Perhaps this field should be standard in all Attestations.
# TODO: Should we add a way to add additional information, such as which was the
#       VM base image or how it should be considered w.r.t. licensing?
#       If so, we may want to add more structure. Then again, we could always do
#       that in a future version if needed.
# TODO: Should we make this an array so that it is easier to reference from
#       other fields?
# TODO: What if there are multiple versions of the same resource ID? For
#       example, fetch the same HTTP file twice and get two different artifacts?
materials:
  # The set of independent input artifacts that were not referenced by any other
  # artifact. This is usually a single artifact containing the recipe and source
  # code.
